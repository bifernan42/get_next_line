# Project Get Next Line  

## Concepts: [File Descriptors, Static Variables, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Buffer Management]  

In this project, we had to:  
- Implement **get_next_line()**, a function that reads a file **line by line**  
- Use a **static variable** to store intermediate data between function calls  
- Handle different **buffer sizes** dynamically using `BUFFER_SIZE`  
- Ensure efficient memory management with **minimal reading operations**  
- Support **reading from standard input and files**  

This project provided deeper insight into **file handling, buffer management, and static variable usage in C**.
